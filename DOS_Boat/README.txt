DOS Boat: An Under-c++ Adventure

Michael S. Lewis (c)2018

Overview:
As the user, you will be the captain of a high-tech Digitally Operational 
Submarine, the SS Babbage, and will navigate the bit depths to find and 
retrieve three invaluable relics—-a priceless Golden Floppy Disk,an exquisite 
Silicon Orb, and the legendary Apple of Unobtanium. Years of careful 
research have allowed you to narrow your search to a particular swath of sea, 
so the game is partitioned into a 2x2 grid of spaces. Furthermore, though you 
will start your voyage at sea level, you will dive and surface the vessel, 
making the game board three-dimensional. The surface is the first, top 
level, with the lower depths divided into two additional levels. Thus, the 
game board is a 2x2x3 cube of 12 spaces in total. There are also an 
additional 3 hidden spaces that will become accessible during the game. One 
space will disappear during gameplay, and will become no longer accessible. 
To complete the quest, you must traverse these spaces to find the three 
treasures and then find the secret passage to safety. Some of the spaces may 
prove for smooth sailing, but other spaces will have different
characteristics. Stay alert and on the lookout for sea monsters, hazards, and 
underwater alien technology, as well as the ruthless Dr.Bug, who will stop at 
nothing to sabotage you so that he may locate and recover the ancient relics 
first.

Other details:
The user will begin with 10 Strength Points, which will diminish if damage is 
taken. If strength reaches 0, the submarine is destroyed and the game is over. 
If more than 25 moves are made, then you will lose to Dr. Bug and the game is 
over. There will be opportunities to recover Strength Paints to repair damage 
the vessel might have taken. Within each space, the user will be offered a 
choice of commands to issue, such as N for north, S for south, E for east, W 
for west, D to dive down, and U to move one level toward the surface. These 
commands will be available depending on where on the map the user is located. 
For example, at a bottom depth space, it will not be possible to dive further. 
The user may type Q to quit at any time. At the beginning of game play, a 
brief list of objectives will be displayed and the user will also be offered 
to view a hint for each space. There will be a Babbage class, which will act 
as the user’s interface with the world. The world will be represented by an 
Ocean base class, from which there will be several inherited classes.
